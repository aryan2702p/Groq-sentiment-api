# Sentiment Analysis API Documentation

## Our Approach: Turning Reviews into Insights

Hey there! So, you want to know how I tackled the challenge of sentiment analysis? Grab a coffee, and let's dive in!

I started with a simple idea: what if I could take a bunch of customer reviews and figure out how people really feel? Not just "thumbs up" or "thumbs down", but actual nuanced sentiment. Sounds cool, right?

Here's how I made it happen:

1. **File Handling**: First things first, I needed to deal with different file types. CSV, XLSX - you name it, I handle it. I use pandas for this because, let's face it, pandas is aIsome for data manipulation.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: This is where the magic happens. I teamed up with the Groq API (it's free, by the way!) to analyze each review. I ask Groq to give us scores for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. It's like having a really smart friend read each review and tell you, "Hmm, this one's 70% positive, 20% neutral, and 10% negative."

3. **Result Processing**: Once I get those scores, I do a bit of number crunching to make sure everything adds up (literally - the scores should sum to 1). If something looks off, I normalize the scores. It's like making sure all the slices of the sentiment pie add up to a whole pie.

4. **Data Enrichment**: Instead of just giving you a summary, I thought, "Why not add this cool info back into your original data?" So that's exactly what I do. I take your original file and add three new columns: positive, negative, and neutral scores for each review.

5. **Easy Retrieval**: Finally, I package all this up into a new CSV file and send it right back to you. It's like I're saying, "Here's your data, but now it's got superpoIrs!"

## Structured Response: Keeping It Clean and Clear

I're all about that structure, you know? Here's how I keep our responses neat and tidy:

1. For each review, I return a JSON object that looks like this:
   ```json
   {
     "positive": 0.7,
     "negative": 0.1,
     "neutral": 0.2
   }
   ```
   Clean, simple, easy to read. Just how I like it.

2. In the final CSV, you'll see these scores as new columns. It's like your original data, but with a sentiment makeover.

## API Usage: Let's See It in Action!

Alright, let's get practical. Here's how you'd use our API:

1. First, make sure you've got our API running. If you're testing locally, it'll probably be at `http://localhost:5000`.

2. Got a CSV file full of juicy reviews? Great! Let's analyze it. Here's how you'd do it with cURL:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST -F "file=@your_reviews.csv" http://localhost:5000/analyze --output analyzed_reviews.csv
   ```

3. Sit back, relax, and let the API do its thing. In a few moments, you'll get a new CSV file called `analyzed_reviews.csv`.

Let's say your original CSV looked like this:
```
Review
"This product is amazing! Best purchase ever."
"Meh, it's okay I guess."
"Terrible experience. Never buying again."
```

Your new `analyzed_reviews.csv` might look something like this:
```
Review,positive,negative,neutral
"This product is amazing! Best purchase ever.",0.8,0.1,0.1
"Meh, it's okay I guess.",0.2,0.3,0.5
"Terrible experience. Never buying again.",0.1,0.8,0.1
```

Cool, right?

## The Good, The Bad, and The "I're Working On It"

Look, I're proud of our little API, but I're not gonna pretend it's perfect. Here's the lowdown:

### What I Love
- It's simple to use. Send a file, get a file. Easy peasy.
- It handles different file types. CSV, XLSX - I've got you covered.
- It gives nuanced sentiment scores. Life isn't just positive or negative, and neither are reviews.

### What I're Still Working On
- Speed: Let's be honest, for big files, it can be a bit slow. I're working on making it zippier.
- Language Support: Right now, it works best with English. I're hoping to add more languages soon.
- Customization: Sometimes you might want to tIak how the sentiment is calculated. I're thinking about ways to make this more flexible.

## Final Thoughts: The Journey of a Thousand Reviews Begins with a Single API Call

I built this API because I believe that understanding customer sentiment shouldn't require a Ph.D. in data science. It should be as easy as sending a file and getting insights back.

Is it perfect? Nah. But is it useful? I sure think so. And I're excited to keep improving it.

So go ahead, give it a spin! Feed it your reviews, see what insights pop out. And hey, if you think of ways I could make it even better, I're all ears. After all, the best tools are built by people who actually use them.

Happy analyzing, folks! May your positive sentiments be high and your API calls be swift.
